   The SF_Crime_Classification.ipynb file contains an Principal Component Analysis extension to the Kaggle competition submission file by my project group (group members: https://github.com/franklooi, https://github.com/cbmitchell1, https://github.com/ritakurban).

* NLP for Stock Market Prediction: Word Embedding & Majority-Vote Predictions

  The NLP_DJIA_Predictions.ipynb file contains an extension to my group's work (group members: https://github.com/franklooi, https://github.com/PreciousEnahoro, https://github.com/AntonioStark). I replaced Word2Vec-generated vectors by GloVe vectors and changed the model to be word-based rather than headline based.
